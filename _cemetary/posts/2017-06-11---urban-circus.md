A nice job albiet a little messy. I was taking over a codebase from another developer whose React skills were questionable at best.

The task was to finish an admin panel. I found this very interesting because it was related to panorama images.

There was already a purchased template to help with the UI creation.

This was one of the few jobs in which I didn't use Typescript.
