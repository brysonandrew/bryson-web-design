This was my training period in web development where I was transitioning from being a full-time English teacher to full-time front-end developer.

The process took about five years, starting as just curiosity, to creating many different versions of my English teaching website on Wordpress, and from there experimenting with everything that comes along with optimizing a website.

After hitting too many walls with Wordpress I started learning about Javascript and HTML5 Canvas. Even making some simple games, including a flamethrowing tarantula and a quiz game for learning English based off the PS4 game Witcher III.
