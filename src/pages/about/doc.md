        What I do
      </h3>
      <p>
        I design and build front-end experiences that feel
        fast, intuitive, and polished.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h4 className="title-main">My work spans:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>React / Next.js applications</li>
          <li>Vue / Nuxt applications</li>
          <li>API-driven and headless CMS setups</li>
          <li>High-performance, SEO-optimised websites</li>
          <li>UI/UX for interactive and media-rich apps</li>
          <li>
            Advanced animations (Framer Motion, GSAP,
            scroll-based, micro-interactions)
          </li>
          <li>
            AI-powered interfaces for creative,
            productivity, and automation tools
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        I focus on performance, maintainability, and
        long-term scalability — writing clean code that your
        team can build on.

      <h3>How I work</h3>

      <h4>My approach is simple:</h4>
      <p>
        communicate clearly, deliver reliably, and respect
        your time.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>I provide realistic estimates</li>
        <li>I share progress early and often</li>
        <li>I solve problems collaboratively</li>
        <li>
          I keep codebases tidy, consistent, and documented
        </li>
        <li>
          I take ownership of the work from start to finish
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I treat every project like a partnership, not a
        handoff.
      </p>

      <h3>Who I work with</h3>

      <h4>I’ve collaborated with:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>digital agencies</li>
        <li>SaaS companies</li>
        <li>creative studios</li>
        <li>e-commerce teams</li>
        <li>startups and founders</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        …across New Zealand, Australia, Europe, and North
        America — often bridging multiple time zones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you need a single front-end feature, a
        complete web application, or ongoing support, I can
        integrate smoothly with your team and deliver work
        you can trust.
      </p>

      <h3>A bit more about me</h3>

      <p>
        I’m originally from New Zealand, now based in
        Poland, working primarily with clients in Europe,
        Australia, and North America.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of development, I spend my time creating
        AI-driven projects, audio tools, and music — often
        combining technology and creativity in unique ways.
      </p>

      <h3>Let’s work together</h3>

      <p>
        If you need a senior front-end developer who values
        clarity, quality, and reliability, I’d be happy to
        help.
