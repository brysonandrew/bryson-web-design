This was a very part time job that went for a very long time. It was nice work and well organized.

The task was to create a web-based form for people to use with tablets when walking the streets and collecting donations.

It was particularly interesting because the form needed to be network resistant. That includes when a user loses internet connectivity. Their information must be stored and once only must be sent to our server.

There were also a number of "smart" features for the form that were interesting including phone number, email, IBAN and address validation and autocorrect.
