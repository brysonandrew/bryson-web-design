This was a large project spanning over 6 months and involved working closely with a coding mentor of mine, assisting in building and adding pages for an existing e-commerce website.

I worked as a front-end developer in a team of 1 x PM, 1 x designer and 4 x developers.Speed, animations and user experience were cruicial factors to the success of the project.

The team was very well managed (Jira) and communication worked very well.

After completion of the additional pages and fine-tuning of speed and other optimizations I stepped back as I was no longer needed.
