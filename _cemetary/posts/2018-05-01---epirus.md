Nicely organized project in an interesting area of technology.

Project was to create a web app out of wireframes. The wireframes are produced by a talented designer with designs in Invision & Figma.

Some complex UI rendering such as interactive tool tips that show when hovering over inline text and table cells. Managed to create some nice components for the rendering, particularly with React's new component hooks, with small difference for inline or other.
