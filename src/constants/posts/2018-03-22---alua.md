This was a large project spanning over 8 months and involved the rewrite of an existing Angular project into React.

As the sole web developer in a team consisting of a PM, designer, two QAs, Android dev and Ios dev, it was crucial that I got the required info needed to implement the app features correctly.

The feel of the product needed to be app-like and mobile-first.

The project was enjoyable and taught me the importance of clean, scalable code. This was underpinned by the effective use of Typescript, Redux and Webpack.

After completion of the core functionality of the app I handed the project to a new dev.
